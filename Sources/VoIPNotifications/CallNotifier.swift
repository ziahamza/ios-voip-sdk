/// Posts a communication notification for each call that Do Not Disturb or a Focus filtered, so
/// that the people a Focus allows still reach the user.
///
/// LiveCommunicationKit doesn't present a call that a Focus filters, even from a person the Focus
/// allows: the SDK keeps the call as a call preview, or ends it as filtered (see ADR 0005). A
/// communication notification about the call gets through instead. The system presents it for the
/// people the Focus allows, and adds it quietly to Notification Center for everyone else.
///
/// Create the notifier when the app launches, and pass it to
/// `VoIPClient.start(framework:media:push:audio:observers:configuration:clock:)` as an observer,
/// so that it sees the call of the VoIP push that cold-launched the app:
///
/// ```swift
/// let notifier = CallNotifier(center: center)
/// let client = try VoIPClient.start(
///   framework: LiveCommunicationKitAdapter(), media: AppMedia(), push: PushKitSource(),
///   observers: [notifier])
/// ```
///
/// ## When it posts
///
/// The notifier posts one notification for a call, of kind ``CallNotification/Kind/incoming``:
///
/// - when the call becomes a call preview because Do Not Disturb or a Focus filtered it, with
///   reason `PreviewReason.filtered(.doNotDisturb)`;
/// - when the presentation policy shows the call as a call preview, with reason
///   `PreviewReason.policy`, if ``Options/triggers`` include ``Triggers/previewedByPolicy``.
///
/// When the presentation policy doesn't preview filtered calls, a call that Do Not Disturb or a
/// Focus filtered ends at once as `EndReason.filtered(.doNotDisturb)`. The notifier then posts only
/// what ``Options/endedWithoutJoining`` asks for: a missed-call notification by default.
///
/// It never posts for a call that rings, a call that the system filtered because the caller is on
/// the block list or without saying why, or a call answered elsewhere. Its notifications never
/// ring: their interruption level is passive or active, and their sound is the default or none
/// (see ADR 0009).
///
/// ## After it posts
///
/// - When the call is joined on this device, the notifier withdraws the call's notification,
///   unless ``Options/withdrawsWhenJoined`` is off.
/// - When the call ends without being joined on this device, the notifier replaces the
///   notification with a missed-call notification, of kind ``CallNotification/Kind/missed``.
///   ``Options/endedWithoutJoining`` can keep or remove it instead.
///
/// Follow what happens to the notifications with ``events()``.
